# BBP-Scheduler-Burst-and-Bonus-Priority-Scheduler-
The **BBP Scheduler** selects processes based on **Effective Priority = (1 / burst time) + (1 / (waiting time + 1))**, favoring shorter bursts and longer waits. This approach balances fairness and efficiency, minimizing turnaround and waiting time.
